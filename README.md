MOOUU PROTOTYPES:
Work in progress on Multi objective optimisation under uncertainty

FOLDERS:

	ANIMATIONS
 	contains code for a simple animation of algorithms, as well as .mp4 files.
 	These show an animation of SPEA, NSGA_II, and SPEA2 on test problem ZDT1.

 	GENETIC ALGORITHMS
 	contains code for an abstract evolutionary algorithm class, and 3 algorithms, NSGA_II, SPEA, and SPEA2

 	TEST PROBLEMS
 	contains two scipts. Problem suite contains 5 deterministic ZDT test problems.
 	StochasticProblemSuite currently contains two original test problems which are probabilistic

 	TESTS
 	contains tests (or at least will) for all modules 

 	UU
 	contains UncertaintyPropogation.py, a module for FOSM and Ensemble based propogation of uncertainty for models

 	WRAPPERS
 	wrap arounds for test problems for integrating GNSMOO with the PEST and pyemu frameworks
